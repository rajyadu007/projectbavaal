        <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">When visitors leave comments on the site we collect the data shown in the comments form, and also the visitor’s IP address and browser user agent string to help spam detection.</p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-700 mt-6 mb-3">Media</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">If you upload images to the website, you should avoid uploading images with embedded location data (EXIF GPS) included.</p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-700 mt-6 mb-3">Cookies</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">If you leave a comment on our site you may opt-in to saving your name, email address and website in cookies. These are for your convenience so that you do not have to fill in your details again when you leave another comment. These cookies will last for one year.</p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">If you edit or publish an article, an additional cookie will be saved in your browser. This cookie includes no personal data and simply indicates the post ID of the article you just edited. It expires after 1 day.</p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-700 mt-6 mb-3">Embedded content from other websites</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">Articles on our site may include embedded content (e.g. videos, images, articles, etc.). Embedded content from other websites behaves in the exact same way as if the visitor has visited the other website.</p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">These websites may collect data about you, use cookies, embed additional third-party tracking, and monitor your interaction with that embedded content, including tracking your interaction with the embedded content if you have an account and are logged in to that website.</p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-700 mt-6 mb-3">How long we retain your data</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">If you leave a comment, the comment and its metadata are retained indefinitely. This is so we can recognize and approve any follow-up comments automatically instead of holding them in a moderation queue.</p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-700 mt-6 mb-3">What rights you have over your data</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">If you have left comments, you can request to receive an exported file of the personal data we hold about you, including any data you have provided to us. You can also request that we erase any personal data we hold about you. This does not include any data we are obliged to keep for administrative, legal, or security purposes.</p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-700 mt-6 mb-3">Where your data is sent</h2>
