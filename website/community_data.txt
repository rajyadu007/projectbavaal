Guys, you won’t believe – I actually spotted Hande Erçel at a café in Cihangir last weekend! She was sitting with her friends, laughing and looking so chilled out. Honestly, I always thought she’s so glamorous on Instagram, but in person, she seemed totally down-to-earth. Has anyone here ever met her or spoken to her? There’s so much gossip online, but what do you all feel she’s genuinely like as a person?

Yaar, you’re so lucky! I’ve only seen her on TV and Insta, haven’t even dreamt of seeing her in real life. She actually comes across as very sweet and approachable. Whatever negative news comes online, I never believe – even my cousin met her at an event and she said Hande was super polite with everyone.

I have to share this – when my younger sister was admitted in the hospital, I messaged Hande on Insta. Never thought anyone would reply but her team responded and she actually sent a short video wishing my sister speedy recovery! We were so touched by her gesture, truly shows she has a big heart.

She’s trending everywhere on social, but honestly I really like her acting too. Especially in "Sen Çal Kapımı," she was so natural – made you feel all those emotions. She gives really positive vibes, I feel she’s as cheerful and friendly in real life too.

My mom actually once painted a portrait of Hande Erçel and I posted it on Insta, tagging her – she liked the post and even sent a heart emoji! It’s lovely how she takes time for her fans, really means a lot for people who look up to her.

You know what I love about Hande? Her fashion sense! Every look she puts together starts a new trend, and brands literally run after her for collaborations. She totally deserves all this popularity. According to you all, which brand partnership of hers has been the best so far?

I’m a huge fan of her Nocturne collab. Every season is just on point! I really wait to see her looks. And her makeup is always flawless too – she makes it look effortless, na?

For me, her L’Oréal Paris ads are unbeatable. She’s confident and looks so natural on camera. But I agree, Nocturne fits her style perfectly. She seriously brings everything she wears to life!
